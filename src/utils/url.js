// where parseRoom() is called globally. Exposed on the window object to avoid breaking
// existing calls until a complete refactor is performed.

// Bridge to the global scope
// This block attempts to attach the parseRoom function to the global window object
// if it is not already defined. This ensures backward compatibility with existing
// code that relies on a global parseRoom function.
// The try-catch handles environments such as web workers where 'window' is undefined.
